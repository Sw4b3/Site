                    <h1>General Information</h1>
                    <h2>About Asperger</h2>
                    <p class="content" >
                        <b>Asperger Syndrome</b> is one of several previously separate subtypes of autism that were folded into the single diagnosis Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).
                    </p><p class="content" style="padding-bottom: 5%">Asperger Syndrome was generally considered to be on the “high functioning” end of the spectrum. Affected children and adults have difficulty with social interactions 
                           and exhibit a restricted range of interests and/or repetitive behaviors. Motor development may be delayed, leading to clumsiness or uncoordinated motor movements. 
                           Compared with those affected by other forms of ASD, however, those with Asperger syndrome do not have significant delays or difficulties in language or cognitive development. 
                           Some even demonstrate precocious vocabulary – often in a highly specialized field of interest.
                           </p>
                           </div>
                           <div class="card body_content">
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p class="content">
                    The following characteristics are often associated with Asperger syndrome, though it is advised to see a specialist
                    rather then self-diagnose:
                </p>
                <ul class="content-list">
                    <li><span>Limited or inappropriate social interactions</span></li>
                    <li><span>Robotic or repetitive speech</span></li>
                    <li><span>Challenges with nonverbal communication (gestures, facial expression, etc.) coupled with average to above average verbal skills</span></li>
                    <li><span>Tendency to discuss self rather than others</span></li>
                    <li><span>Inability to understand social/emotional issues or nonliteral phrases</span></li>
                    <li><span>Lack of eye contact or reciprocal conversation</span></li>
                    <li><span>Obsession with specific, often unusual, topics</span></li>
                    <li><span>One-sided conversations</span></li>
                    <li><span>Awkward movements and/or mannerisms</span></li>
                </ul>
                <p class="content" style="padding-bottom: 5%">
                    Though many of these characteristic are present in someone whose is diagnosed with Asperger's disorder, they are seldom all present 
                    in any one individual and vary widely in degree
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="card body_content">
                <h2>Diagnosed</h2>
                <p class="content">Asperger syndrome often remains undiagnosed until a child or adult begins to have serious difficulties in school, the workplace or their personal lives. Indeed, many adults with Asperger syndrome receive their diagnosis when seeking help for related issues such as anxiety or depression.
                    Diagnosis tends to center primarily on difficulties with social interactions.</p>
                <p class="content">Children with Asperger syndrome tend to show typical or even exceptional language development. However, many tend to use their language skills inappropriately or awkwardly in conversations or social situations such as interacting with their peers. Often, the symptoms of Asperger 
                    syndrome are confused with those of other behavioral issues such as attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Indeed, many persons affected by Asperger syndrome are initially diagnosed 
                    with ADHD until it becomes clear that their difficulties stem more from an inability to socialize than an inability to focus their attention.</p> 

                <p class="content">Another common symptom is an inability to understand the intent behind another person’s actions, words and behaviors. So children and adults affected by Asperger syndrome may miss humor and other implications. Similarly, they may not instinctually respond to such “universal” 
                    nonverbal cues such as a smile, frown or “come here” motion.</p>

                <p class="content">For these reasons, social interactions can seem confusing and overwhelming to individuals with Asperger syndrome. Difficulties in seeing things from another person's perspective can make it extremely difficult to predict or understand the actions of others. They may not pick up on what is or isn’t appropriate in a particular situation. For instance, someone with 
                    Asperger syndrome might speak too loudly when entering a church service or a room with a sleeping baby – and not understand when “shushed.”</p>

                <p class="content" >Some individuals with Asperger syndrome have a peculiar manner of speaking. This can involve speaking overly loud, in a monotone or with an unusual intonation. It is also common, but not universal, for people with Asperger syndrome to have difficulty controlling their emotions. 
                    They may cry or laugh easily or at inappropriate times.</p>
                <p class="content" style="padding-bottom: 5%">Another common, but not universal, sign is an awkwardness or delay in motor skills. As children, in particular, they may have difficulties on the playground because they can’t catch a ball or understand how to swing on the monkey bars despite 
                    their peers’ repeated attempts to teach them.</p>
